# Focus-Blur-Keyboardpress-HTML5loadevent
In this project, We explored how The load event is commonly used to trigger scripts that access the contents of the page. In this example, a function called setup() gives focus to the text input when the page has loaded. 

Also, we explored how the text input gains and loses focus, feedback is shown to the user in the element under the text input. The feedback is given using two functions.

Moreover, We explored the DOMContentloaded event we fires before the load event (because the latter waits for all of the page's resources to load). If users try to leave the page before they press the submit button, the beforeun load event checks that they want to leave.
